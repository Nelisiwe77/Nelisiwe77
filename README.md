# Hey there 👋 I'm Nelisiwe Maseko

I'm a passionate beginner in the world of tech — currently exploring code, creativity, and content creation. I'm part of the **FNB App Academy 2025**, where I'm learning how to build real-world apps step by step.

## 💻 What I'm Learning
- HTML & CSS
- Git & GitHub
- JavaScript
- Building fun projects like a superhero-themed app ⚡️

## 🌱 My Current Focus
- Growing as a developer
- Sharing my journey through content
- Building confidence, one line of code at a time

## 🎯 Goals
- Create simple and useful web apps
- Collaborate with other beginner devs
- Blend creativity and code (because I’m also into beauty, DIY, and digital storytelling!)
